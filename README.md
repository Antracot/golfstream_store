# golfstream_webpage
This is web resourse company "GolfStream". All design and functions was writing and testing by me and now it's on support level for our small team. 
Here I show code and scripts without true content but all functions and views are correct!
I created this page with the help of populare frameworks like jquery, bxslider, boostrap, googlemap API, youtube API and basic 
knowledge in html5/css3. Adaptive design for resizing page from 1000px to 600px in height was making with the help of css/html wrap only!)  
Callbecks and forms send info to mailbox was making on php5. Page was testing on validation on "validator.w3.org" and correct build and optimization was verifing on "PageSpeed Insights" dev tools. Global requrements was the main document for me of course!!!)))       
Built this project with the help of Gulp, Bower and pre-processor SASS.
